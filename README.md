Supybot-Stock
=============

Supybot plugin for displaying stock and financial information.

The "Stock" plugins for Supybot suck. All use some simple Yahoo hack when there are quite a few sites (Yahoo/Google) that offer
formal xml/JSON data. This uses a mixture of both.

First, Yahoo, via opentables/YQL has a plethora of data available. The only thing they lack is indicies like the DJI. This is where
I used Google. 

I added a bit of formatting to the plugin so it displays nicely.
